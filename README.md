# Programming with Javascript #

This repo contains the course materials for **Programmiersprachen 1**. There is basic education material as well 
as folders with exercises for the students.

The general structure is as follows:
 
    root directory            administrative files and the more important all the .html files (our documents)
    |- css directory         stylesheet files for look and feel of our documents
    |- img directory         images of various types
    |- js directory          javascript files for the actual programming
    |- lib directory         javascript library files from others with ready-made functionality
    
Why such a structure? To keep everything nice and tidy. Programming tends to get complicated with a lot of files around
and this structure at least keeps similar things together.
