Room: 148: Bank Entrance
 You are in the large entrance hall of the Bank of Zork, the largest
 banking institution of the Great Underground Empire.  A partial
 account of its history is in "The Lives of the Twelve Flatheads" with
 the chapter on J. Pierpont Flathead.  A more detailed history (albeit
 less objective) may be found in Flathead's outrageous autobiography
 "I'm Rich and You Aren't - So There!".
 Most of the furniture has been ravaged by passing scavengers.  All
 that remains are two signs at the northwest and northeast corners of
 the room, which say

 The engravings were incised in the living rock of the cave wall by
 an unknown hand.  They depict, in symbolic form, the beliefs of the
 ancient peoples of Zork.  Skillfully interwoven with the bas reliefs
 are excerpts illustrating the major tenets expounded by the sacred
 texts of the religion of that time.  Unfortunately, a later age seems
 to have considered them blasphemous and just as skillfully excised them.

 be made out seems to be a diatribe against small insects, absent-
 mindedness, and the picking up and dropping of small objects.  The
 final verse seems to consign trespassers to the land of the
 dead.  All evidence indicates that the beliefs of the ancient
 Zorkers were obscure indeed.

 		   Guide Book To
 		Flood Control Dam #3
 
   Flood control dam #3 (FCD #3) was constructed in year 783 of the
 Great Underground Empire to harness the destructive power of the
 Frigid River.  This work was supported by a grant of 37 million
 zorkmids from the central bureaucracy and your own omnipotent local
 tyrant Lord Dimwit Flathead the Excessive.  This impressive structure
 is composed of 3.7 cubic feet of concrete, is 256 feet tall at the
 center, and 193 feet wide at the top.  The reservoir created behind
 the dam has a volume of 37 billion cubic feet, an area of 12 million
 square feet, and a shore line of 36 thousand feet.
 
   The construction of FCD #3 took 112 days from ground breaking to
 the dedication.  It required a work force of 384 slaves, 34 slave
 drivers, 12 engineers, 2 turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear
 tree.  The work was managed by a command team composed of 234
 bureaucrats, 2347 secretaries (at least two of whom could type),
 12,256 paper shufflers, 52,469 rubber stampers, 245,193 red tape
 processors, and nearly one million dead trees.
 
   We will now point out some of the more interesting features of
 FCD #3 as we conduct you on a guided tour of the facilities.

 		 US NEWS & DUNGEON REPORT
 11-MAR-91					Late Dungeon Edition
 
 		--- LATE NEWS FLASH!! ---
 The endgame is here!  (Somewhere)
 There have been some puzzling new discoveries near the Thief's hideaway.
 
 		--- BACKGROUND INFORMATION ---
 
 This version of Dungeon for the PDP-11/VAX-11 has been completely
 reimplemented in FORTRAN-IV from the original MDL sources created
 at MIT.  The parser in this version is somewhat simpler than the
 parser in the ARPAnet version;  within this limit, this version
 is fully congruent with the current version on the ARPAnet.
 
 This version has been converted from FORTRAN-IV to C via f77.  If
 you have any problems, please report them to:

 	You too can make BIG MONEY in the exciting field of
 		      PAPER SHUFFLING!
 
 Mr. TAA of Muddle, Mass. says:  "Before I took this course I used
 to be a lowly bit twiddler.  Now with what I learned at MIT Tech
 I feel really important and can obfuscate and confuse with the best."
 
 Mr. MARC had this to say:  "Ten short days ago all I could look
 forward to was a dead-end job as a engineer.  Now I have a promising
 future and make really big Zorkmids."
 
 MIT Tech can't promise these fantastic results to everyone, but when
 you earn your MDL degree from MIT Tech your future will be brighter.

 		    Welcome to Dungeon!
 
    Dungeon is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it
 you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal
 man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained
 within.
 
    In Dungeon, the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets
 of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for
 vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by
 fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!
 
    No DECsystem should be without one!
 
    Dungeon was created at the Programming Technology Division of the MIT
 Laboratory for Computer Science by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce
 Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the Adventure game of
 Crowther and Woods, and the Dungeons and Dragons game of Gygax
 and Arneson.  The original version was written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).
 The current version was translated from MDL into FORTRAN IV by
 a somewhat paranoid DEC engineer who prefers to remain anonymous,
 and was later translated to C.

 Useful commands:
 
    The 'BRIEF' command suppresses printing of long room descriptions
 for rooms which have been visited.  The 'SUPERBRIEF' command suppresses
 printing of long room descriptions for all rooms.  The 'VERBOSE'
 command restores long descriptions.
    The 'INFO' command prints information which might give some idea
 of what the game is about.
    The 'QUIT' command prints your score and asks whether you wish
 to continue playing.
    The 'SAVE' command saves the state of the game for later continuation.
    The 'RESTORE' command restores a saved game.
    The 'INVENTORY' command lists the objects in your possession.
    The 'LOOK' command prints a description of your surroundings.
    The 'SCORE' command prints your current score and ranking.
    The 'TIME' command tells you how long you have been playing.
    The 'DIAGNOSE' command reports on your injuries, if any.
 
 Command abbreviations:
 
    The 'INVENTORY' command may be abbreviated 'I'.
    The 'LOOK' command may be abbreviated 'L'.
    The 'QUIT' command may be abbreviated 'Q'.
 
 Containment:
 
    Some objects can contain other objects.  Many such containers can
 be opened and closed.  The rest are always open.   They may or may
 not be transparent.  For you to access (e.g., take) an object
 which is in a container, the container must be open.  For you
 to see such an object, the container must be either open or
 transparent.  Containers have a capacity, and objects have sizes;
 the number of objects which will fit therefore depends on their
 sizes.  You may put any object you have access to (it need not be
 in your hands) into any other object.  At some point, the program
 will attempt to pick it up if you don't already have it, which
 process may fail if you're carrying too much.  Although containers
 can contain other containers, the program doesn't access more than
 one level down.
 
 Fighting:
 
    Occupants of the dungeon will, as a rule, fight back when
 attacked.  In some cases, they may attack even if unprovoked.
 Useful verbs here are 'ATTACK <villain> WITH <weapon>', 'KILL',
 etc.  Knife-throwing may or may not be useful.  You have a
 fighting strength which varies with time.  Being in a fight,
 getting killed, and being injured all lower this strength.
 Strength is regained with time.  Thus, it is not a good idea to
 fight someone immediately after being killed.  Other details
 should become apparent after a few melees or deaths.
 
 Command parser:
 
    A command is one line of text terminated by a carriage return.
 For reasons of simplicity, all words are distinguished by their
 first six letters.  All others are ignored.  For example, typing
 'DISASSEMBLE THE ENCYCLOPEDIA' is not only meaningless, it also
 creates excess effort for your fingers.  Note that this trunca-
 tion may produce ambiguities in the intepretation of longer words.
 
    You are dealing with a fairly stupid parser, which understands
 the following types of things--
 
    Actions:
 	Among the more obvious of these, such as TAKE, PUT, DROP, etc.
 	Fairly general forms of these may be used, such as PICK UP,
 	PUT DOWN, etc.
 
    Directions:
 	NORTH, SOUTH, UP, DOWN, etc. and their various abbreviations.
 	Other more obscure directions (LAND, CROSS) are appropriate in
 	only certain situations.
 
    Objects:
 	Most objects have names and can be referenced by them.
 
    Adjectives:
 	Some adjectives are understood and required when there are
 	two objects which can be referenced with the same 'name' (e.g.,
 	DOORs, BUTTONs).
 
    Prepositions:
 	It may be necessary in some cases to include prepositions, but
 	the parser attempts to handle cases which aren't ambiguous
 	without.  Thus 'GIVE CAR TO DEMON' will work, as will 'GIVE DEMON
 	CAR'.  'GIVE CAR DEMON' probably won't do anything interesting.
 	When a preposition is used, it should be appropriate;  'GIVE CAR
 	WITH DEMON' won't parse.
 
    Sentences:
 	The parser understands a reasonable number of syntactic construc-
 	tions.  In particular, multiple commands (separated by commas)
 	can be placed on the same line.
 
    Ambiguity:
 	The parser tries to be clever about what to do in the case of
 	actions which require objects that are not explicitly specified.
 	If there is only one possible object, the parser will assume
 	that it should be used.  Otherwise, the parser will ask.
 	Most questions asked by the parser can be answered.

 Welcome to Dungeon!
 
    You are near a large dungeon, which is reputed to contain vast
 quantities of treasure.   Naturally, you wish to acquire some of it.
 In order to do so, you must of course remove it from the dungeon.  To
 receive full credit for it, you must deposit it safely in the trophy
 case in the living room of the house.
 
    In addition to valuables, the dungeon contains various objects
 which may or may not be useful in your attempt to get rich.  You may
 need sources of light, since dungeons are often dark, and weapons,
 since dungeons often have unfriendly things wandering about.  Reading
 material is scattered around the dungeon as well;  some of it
 is rumored to be useful.
 
    To determine how successful you have been, a score is kept.
 When you find a valuable object and pick it up, you receive a
 certain number of points, which depends on the difficulty of finding
 the object.  You receive extra points for transporting the treasure
 safely to the living room and placing it in the trophy case.  In
 addition, some particularly interesting rooms have a value associated
 with visiting them.  The only penalty is for getting yourself killed,
 which you may do only twice.
 
    Of special note is a thief (always carrying a large bag) who
 likes to wander around in the dungeon (he has never been seen by the
 light of day).  He likes to take things.  Since he steals for pleasure
 rather than profit and is somewhat sadistic, he only takes things which
 you have seen.  Although he prefers valuables, sometimes in his haste
 he may take something which is worthless.  From time to time, he examines
 his take and discards objects which he doesn't like.  He may occas-
 ionally stop in a room you are visiting, but more often he just wanders
 through and rips you off (he is a skilled pickpocket).
Message: 6
 Please answer the question.
Message: 7
 You clearly are a suicidal maniac.  We don't allow psychotics in the
 dungeon, since they may harm other adventurers.  Your remains will be
 installed in the land of the living dead, where your fellow adventurers
 may gloat over them.

 reservoir.  However, with the water level lowered, there is merely
 a wide stream running through the center of the room.
Message: 33
 There is a western exit, a passageway south, and a steep pathway
 climbing up along the edge of a cliff.

 You are in large room which seems to be air conditioned.  In one
 corner there is a machine (?) which is shaped somewhat like a clothes
 dryer.  On the 'panel' there is a switch which is labelled in an
 obscure dialect of Swahili.  Fortunately, I know this dialect, and the
 label translates to 'START'.  The switch does not appear to be manip-
 ulable by any human hand (unless the fingers are about 1/16 by 1/4
 inch).  On the front of the machine is a large lid, which is #.

 You are at the periphery of a large dome, which forms the ceiling

 You are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed:
 
 	"Abandon every hope, all ye who enter here."
 
 The gate is open.  Through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of
 mangled corpses in one corner.  Thousands of voices, lamenting some
 hideous fate, can be heard.
Message: 60
 The way through the gate is barred by evil spirits, who jeer at your
 attempts to pass.
Message: 61
 There is a clap of thunder, and a voice echoes through the
 cavern:  "Begone, chomper!"  Apparently, the voice thinks you
 are an evil spirit and dismisses you from the land of the living.
Message: 62
 You are not equipped for an exorcism.
Message: 63
 There is a clap of thunder, and a voice echoes through the
 cavern:  "Begone, fiends!"  The spirits, sensing the presense

Message: 64
 You have entered the land of the living dead, a large desolate
 room.  Although it is apparently uninhabited, you can hear the
 sounds of thousands of lost souls weeping and moaning.  In
 the east corner are stacked the remains of dozens of previous
 adventurers who were less fortunate than yourself.  To the east
 is an ornate passage, apparently recently constructed.
Message: 65
 Amid the desolation, you spot what appears to be your head,
 tastefully impaled on the end of a long pole.
Message: 66
 You are standing on the top of flood control dam #3, which was
 quite a tourist attraction in times far distant.  There are paths
 to the north, south, east, and down.
Message: 67
 The sluice gates on the dam are closed.  Behind the dam, there can
 be seen a wide lake.  A small stream is formed by the runoff from
 the lake.
Message: 68
 It appears that the dam has been opened, since the water level behind
 the dam is low and the sluice gate is open.  Water is rushing down-
 stream through the gates.
Message: 69
 There is a control panel here.  There is a large metal bolt on the
 panel.  Above the bolt is a small green plastic bubble.

 You hear a scream of anguish as you violate the robber's hideaway.
 Using passages unknown to you, he rushes to its defense.

 suddenly vanish.

 Something seems funny about the feel of the buoy.
Message: 85
 Oh dear, you seem to have gone over Aragain Falls.  Not a very
 smart thing to do, apparently.
Message: 86
 You seem to be digging a hole here.
Message: 87
 The hole is getting deeper, but that's about it.
Message: 88
 You are surrounded by a wall of sand on all sides.
Message: 89
 You can see a small statue in the sand.
Message: 90
 The wall collapses, smothering you.
Message: 91
 There is nothing to dig into here.
Message: 92
 You are digging into a pile of bat guano.
Message: 93
 You seem to be getting knee deep in guano.
Message: 94
 You are covered with bat turds, cretin.
Message: 95
 This is getting you nowhere.
Message: 96
 You are at the top of Aragain Falls, an enormous waterfall with a
 drop of about 450 feet.  The only path here is on the north end.
 There is a man-sized barrel here which you could fit into.
Message: 97
 A beautiful rainbow can be seen over the falls and to the east.
Message: 98
 A solid rainbow spans the falls.

 According to Prof. TAA of MIT Tech, the rapidly changing magnetic

 Imbedded in the far wall is a rusty old box.  It appears that
 the box is somewhat damaged, since an oblong hole has been
 chipped out of the front of it.

 The ledge collapses, giving you a narrow escape.

 The force of the explosion has caused the ledge to collapse belatedly.
Message: 112
 The ledge collapses, leaving you with no place to land.
Message: 113
 The ledge collapses, probably as a result of the explosion.  A large
 chunk of it, which is attached to the hook, drags you down to the
 ground.  Fatally.
Message: 114
 The way is blocked by debris from an explosion.
Message: 115
 You may recall your recent explosion.  Well, probably as a result of
 that, you hear an ominous rumbling, as if one of the rooms in the
 dungeon has collapsed.

 The room trembles and 50,000 pounds of rock fall on you,

 The house shakes, and the ceiling of the room you're in collapses,

 A volcano gnome seems to walk straight out of the wall and says,

 Suddenly a sinister, wraithlike figure, cloaked and hooded, appears
 seeming to float in the air before you.  In a low, almost inaudible
 voice he says, "I welcome you to the ranks of the chosen of Zork.  You
 have persisted through many trials and tests and have overcome them
 all.  One such as yourself is fit to join even the implementers!"
 He then raises his oaken staff and, chuckling, drifts away like a
 wisp of smoke, his laughter fading in the distance.

 The slag turns out to be rather insubstantial and crumbles into dust
 at your touch.  It must not have been very valuable.
Message: 123
 The lid opens.
Message: 124
 The lid closes.
Message: 125
 Look around.
Message: 126
 You think it isn't?
Message: 127
 I think you've already done that.
Message: 128
 The trophy case is securely fastened to the wall (perhaps to foil any
 attempt by robbers to remove it).
Message: 129
 The bottle hits the far wall and is decimated.
Message: 130
 The basket is at the other end of the chain.
Message: 131
 A brilliant maneuver destroys the bottle.
Message: 132
 The water splashes on the walls and evaporates immediately.
Message: 133
 The water spills to the floor and evaporates immediately.
Message: 134
 It is not tied to anything.
Message: 135
 There is nothing it can be tied to.
Message: 136
 The rope is already attached.
Message: 137
 The rope drops over the side and comes within ten feet of the floor.
Message: 138
 I see no objects here.
Message: 139
 Although you tied it incorrectly, the rope becomes free.
Message: 140
 The rope drops gently to the floor below.
Message: 141
 The rope is tied to the railing.
Message: 142
 The lamp has smashed into the floor, and the light has gone out.
Message: 143
 The rug is too heavy to lift, but in trying to raise it you
 notice an irregularity beneath it.
Message: 144
 The rug is extremely heavy and cannot be carried.
Message: 145
 With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room.
 With the rug moved, the dusty cover of a closed trap door appears.
Message: 146
 Having moved the carpet previously, you find it impossible
 to move it again.
Message: 147
 You are stopped by a cloud of poisonous gas.
Message: 148
 Time passes... and you die from some obscure poisoning.
Message: 149
 The gnome glances at his watch.  "Oops!  I'm late for an
 an appointment."  He disappears, leaving you alone on the shelf.
Message: 150
 Now you've done it.  It seems that the brick has other properties
 than weight, namely the ability to blow you to smithereens.
Message: 151
 There is an explosion nearby.
Message: 152
 The wire rapidly burns into nothing.
Message: 153
 The match has gone out.
Message: 154
 The lamp appears to be getting dimmer.
Message: 155
 The lamp is dying.
Message: 156
 The candles grow short.
Message: 157
 The candles are very short.
Message: 158
 The leaves burn, and the neighbors start to complain.
Message: 159
 The sight of someone carrying a pile of burning leaves so offends
 the neighbors that they come over and put you out.
Message: 160
 As you pick up the rusty knife, your sword gives a single pulse
 of blinding blue light.
Message: 161
 As the knife approaches its victim, your mind is submerged by an
 overmastering will.  Slowly, your hand turns, until the rusty blade
 is an inch from your neck.  The knife seems almost to sing as it
 savagely cuts your throat.
Message: 162
 A ghost appears in the room and is appalled by your desecration
 of the remains of a fellow adventurer.  He casts a curse on
 all of your valuables and orders them banished to the land of
 the living dead.  The ghost leaves, muttering obscenities.
Message: 163
 There is a rumble from deep within the earth, and the room shakes.
Message: 164
 There is an ugly person staring at you.
Message: 165
 The mirror is broken into many pieces.
Message: 166
 Nobody but a greedy surgeon would allow you to attempt that trick.
Message: 167
 You have broken the mirror.  I hope you have a seven years supply of
 good luck available.
Message: 168
 Haven't you done enough already?
Message: 169
 The torch hits the glacier and explodes into a great ball of flame,
 devouring the glacier.  The water from the melting glacier rushes
 downstream, carrying the torch with it.  In place of the glacier,
 there is a passageway leading west.
Message: 170
 The melting glacier seems to have carried the torch away, leaving
 you in the dark.
Message: 171
 The glacier is unmoved by your ridiculous attempt.
Message: 172
 Part of the glacier melts, drowning you under a torrent of water.
Message: 173
 burned out ivory torch
Message: 174
 There is a burned out ivory torch here.
Message: 175
 The basket is raised to the top of the shaft.
Message: 176
 The basket is lowered to the bottom of the shaft.
Message: 177
 The cage is securely fastened to the iron chain.
Message: 178
 You seem unable to affect these spirits.
Message: 179
 How can you attack a spirit with material objects?
Message: 180
 The book is open to page 569.
Message: 181
 As hard as you try, the book cannot be closed.
Message: 182
 A booming voice says, "Wrong, cretin!", and you notice that you
 have turned into a pile of dust.
Message: 183
 I'm afraid that you have run out of matches.
Message: 184
 One of the matches starts to burn.
Message: 185
 The match is out.
Message: 186
 The tube refuses to accept anything.
Message: 187
 The cyclops yawns and stares at the thing that woke him.
Message: 188
 The cyclops, tired of all your games and trickery, eats you.
 The cyclops says, "Mmm mmm!  Just like mom used to make 'em."
Message: 189
 The cyclops says, "Mmm mmm!  I love hot peppers!  But oh, could I use
 a drink.  Perhaps I could drink the blood of that thing."  From the
 gleam in his eye, it could be surmised that you are 'that thing'.
Message: 190
 The cyclops looks tired and quickly falls fast asleep (what did you
 put in that drink, anyway?).
Message: 191
 The cyclops is apparently not thirsty at the moment and refuses
 your generous gesture.
Message: 192
 The cyclops may be hungry, but there is a limit.
Message: 193
 The cyclops is not so stupid as to eat that!
Message: 194
 The cyclops seems somewhat agitated.
Message: 195
 The cyclops appears to be getting more agitated.
Message: 196
 The cyclops is moving about the room, looking for something.
Message: 197
 The cyclops was looking for salt and pepper.  I think he is gathering
 condiments for his upcoming snack.
Message: 198
 The cyclops is moving toward you in an unfriendly manner.
Message: 199
 You have two choices:  1. Leave  2. Become dinner.
Message: 200
 Your actions don't appear to be doing much harm to the cyclops, but
 they do not exactly lower your insurance premiums, either.
Message: 201
 The cyclops ignores all injuries to his body with a shrug.
Message: 202
 The cyclops is rather heavy and doesn't take kindly to being grabbed.
Message: 203
 You cannot tie the cyclops, although he is fit to be tied.
Message: 204
 Realizing just in time that you'd be stabbed in the back if you
 tried to take the chalice, you return to the fray.
Message: 205
 Congratulations!  Unlike the other vandals, who merely stole the
 artist's masterpieces, you have destroyed one.
Message: 206
 worthless piece of canvas
Message: 207
 There is a worthless piece of canvas here.
Message: 208
 With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow passage.
Message: 209
 The window closes (more easily than it opened).
Message: 210
 The bolt won't turn with your best effort.
Message: 211
 The sluice gates open, and water pours through the dam.
Message: 212
 The sluice gates close, and water starts to collect behind the dam.
Message: 213
 You can't do that!
Message: 214
 The grating is locked.
Message: 215
 The grating opens to reveal trees above you.
Message: 216
 The grating opens.
Message: 217
 The grating is unlocked.
Message: 218
 The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending
 into darkness.
Message: 219
 The door swings shut and closes.
Message: 220
 The door is locked from above.
Message: 221
 The door cannot be opened.
Message: 222
 You cannot burn this door.
Message: 223
 The door is invulnerable.
Message: 224
 You cannot damage this door.
Message: 225
 The door is still under warranty.
Message: 226
 The machine comes to life (figuratively) with a dazzling display
 of colored lights and bizarre noises.  After a few moments, the
 excitement fades.
Message: 227
 The machine doesn't seem to want to do anything.
Message: 228
 A force keeps you from taking the bodies.
Message: 229
 The voice of the guardian of the dungeon booms out from the darkness,
 "Your disrespect has cost you your life!" and places your head on a pole.
Message: 230
 The lights within the room shut off.
Message: 231
 The lights within the room come on.
Message: 232
 Click.
Message: 233
 There is a rumbling sound, and a stream of water appears to burst
 from the east wall of the room (apparently, a leak has occurred
 in a pipe).
Message: 234
 The blue button appears to be jammed.
Message: 235
 The boat must be on the ground to be inflated.
Message: 236
 The boat inflates and appears seaworthy.
Message: 237
 You don't have enough lung power to inflate it.
Message: 238
 This boat will not inflate since some cretin put a hole in it.
Message: 239
 Well done.  The boat is repaired.
Message: 240
 There is a hissing sound and the boat deflates.
Message: 241
 The boat deflates.
Message: 242
 You can't deflate the boat while you're in it.
Message: 243
 The boat must be on the ground to be deflated.
Message: 244
 Very good.
Message: 245
 The rainbow seems to have become somewhat run of the mill.
Message: 246
 Suddenly, the rainbow appears to become solid and, I venture,
 walkable (I think the giveaway was the stairs and bannister).
Message: 247
 The structural integrity of the rainbow seems to have declined
 precipitously, leaving you about 450 feet in the air, supported
 by water vapor.
Message: 248
 The ballon is fastened to the hook.
Message: 249
 The balloon is not tied to anything.
Message: 250
 The wire falls off the hook.
Message: 251
 The box is imbedded in the wall.
Message: 252
 What do you expect, BOOM?
Message: 253
 The box has no door!
Message: 254
 The box is rusted and will not open.
Message: 255
 The box is not open, chomper!
Message: 256
 The wire starts to burn.
Message: 257
 "Thank you very much," he says.  "I don't believe I've seen a
 # as beautiful.  Follow me."  A door appears on the west end
 of the ledge.  Through the door, you can see a narrow chimney
 sloping downward.  The gnome moves quickly, and he disappears
 from sight.
Message: 258
 "That wasn't quite what I had in mind", he says, crunching
 the # in his rock hard hands.
Message: 259
 The gnome appears increasingly nervous.
Message: 260
 Although the implementers are gone, they foresaw that some cretin
 would tamper with their remains.  Therefore, they took steps to
 prevent this.
Message: 261
 Unfortunately, we've run out of poles.  Therefore, in punishment for
 your transgression, we shall deprive you of all your valuables, and
 of your life.
Message: 262
 Congratulations!  You've managed to break all the bottles.  Fortunately
 for your feet, they were made of magic glass and disappear immediately.
Message: 263
 As you reach for the sphere, an iron cage falls from the ceiling
 to entrap you.  To make matters worse, poisonous gas starts coming
 into the room.
Message: 264
 As the robot reaches for sphere, an iron cage falls from the
 ceiling.  The robot attempts to fend it off but is trapped below it.
 Alas, the robot short circuits in his vain attempt to escape and
 crushes the sphere beneath him as he falls to the floor.
Message: 265
 There is a giant spark, and you are fried to a crisp.
Message: 266
 Nothing seems to happen.
Message: 267
 The whirring increases in intensity slightly.
Message: 268
 The whirring decreases in intensity slightly.
Message: 269
 A dull thump is heard in the distance.
Message: 270
 The flask breaks into pieces.
Message: 271
 Here noxious vapors prevent your entry.
Message: 272
 Just before you pass out, you notice that the vapors from the
 flask's contents are fatal.
Message: 273
 Suddenly, the room appears to have become very large.
Message: 274
 The only writing visible is a capital E.  The rest is too small to
 be clearly visible.
Message: 275
 You can't see through that!
Message: 276
 The letters appear larger but are still too small to read.
Message: 277
 The icing, now visible, says "EXPLODE".
Message: 278
 The icing, now visible, says "EVAPORATE".
Message: 279
 The icing, now visible, says "ENLARGE".
Message: 280
 The pool of water evaporates, revealing a tin of rare spices.
Message: 281
 The door to the room seems to be blocked by sticky orange rubble
 from an explosion.  Probably some careless adventurer was playing
 with blasting cakes.
Message: 282
 You have been blasted to smithereens (whatever they are).
Message: 283
 The room around you seems to be getting smaller.
Message: 284
 The room seems to have become too small to hold you.  It seems
 that the walls are not as compressable as your body, which is
 more or less demolished.
Message: 285
 The robot is injured (being of shoddy construction) and falls to the
 floor in a pile of garbage, which disintegrates before your eyes.
Message: 286
 How romantic!
Message: 287
 If you must... Poof, you're dead!
Message: 288
 The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the
 earth.  Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable
 appetite is tempered by its fear of light.  No grue has ever been
 seen by the light of day, and few have survived its fearsome jaws
 to tell the tale.
Message: 289
 There is no grue here, but I'm sure there is at least one lurking in
 the darkness nearby.  I wouldn't let my light go out if I were you!
Message: 290
 The bucket rises and comes to a stop.
Message: 291
 The bucket descends and comes to a stop.
Message: 292
 You notice that the # has burned out, and that
 the cloth bag is starting to deflate.
Message: 293
 I hope you have more light than from a #.
Message: 294
 I didn't realize that adventurers are stupid enough to light a
 # in a room which reeks of coal gas.  Fortunately,
 there is still justice in the world.
Message: 295
 Oh, dear.  It appears that the smell coming from this room was coal
 gas.  I would have thought twice about carrying a # in here.
Message: 296
 There is now a puddle in the middle of the #.
Message: 297
 The water leaks out of the # and evaporates immediately.
Message: 298
 You won't melt it with a #.
Message: 299
 The bolt can't be turned with your #.
Message: 300
 It seems that a # won't do.
Message: 301
 With a #?
Message: 302
 The robot gladly takes the # and nods his headlike
 appendage in thanks.
Message: 303
 A #?  Surely you jest.
Message: 304
 He who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is not fit for the
 kingdom of winners.  In any case, 'BACK' doesn't work.
Message: 305
 You'll have to speak up if you expect me to hear you.
Message: 306
 I don't know how to do that.  I win in all cases.
Message: 307
 At your service!
Message: 308
 The Frobozz Company, Ltd., created, owns, and operates this dungeon.
Message: 309
 Well, FOO, BAR, and BLETCH to you too!
Message: 310
 It could very well be too late.
Message: 311
 The dungeon is ALWAYS open (always room for one more).
Message: 312
 Naturally!
Message: 313
 AAAARRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!
Message: 314
 Very good.  Now you can go to the second grade.
Message: 315
 Have you tried hopping around the dungeon, too?
Message: 316
 Are you enjoying yourself?
Message: 317
 Wheeeeee!
Message: 318
 Do you expect me to applaud?
Message: 319
 Such language in a high-class establishment like this!
Message: 320
 You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Message: 321
 It's not so bad.  You could have been killed already.
Message: 322
 Tough shit, asshole.
Message: 323
 Oh, dear.  Such language from a supposedly winning adventurer!
Message: 324
 That word is henceforth replaced with DUNGEON.
Message: 325
 I think you are taking this thing for granite.
Message: 326
 Brief descriptions.
Message: 327
 Maximum verbosity.
Message: 328
 No long descriptions.
Message: 329
 You can see:  A #.
Message: 330
 Swimming is not allowed in this dungeon.
Message: 331
 I don't really see how.
Message: 332
 I think that swimming is best performed in water.
Message: 333
 Perhaps it is your head that is swimming.
Message: 334
 Wasn't he an Indian?
Message: 335
 I didn't think you would really try to go over the falls in a
 barrel.  It seems that some 450 feet below, you were met by a number
 of unfriendly rocks and boulders, causing your immediate demise.
Message: 336
 Wasn't he a sailor?
Message: 337
 The cyclops, hearing the name of his deadly nemesis, flees the room
 by knocking down the wall on the north side of the room.
Message: 338
 There is a clap of thunder and the east door opens.
Message: 339
 Well what?
Message: 340
 If you pray enough, your prayers may be answered.
Message: 341
 Nothing happens.
Message: 342
 I don't really know how to do that.
Message: 343
 Do you wish to leave the game?
Message: 344
 Underneath the pile of leaves is a grating.
Message: 345
 Underneath the rug is a closed trap door.
Message: 346
 Hello.
Message: 347
 Good day.
Message: 348
 Nice weather we've been having lately.
Message: 349
 Goodbye.
Message: 350
 Here, nothing happens.
Message: 351
 Nothing happens here.
Message: 352
 I think that phrase is getting a bit worn out.
Message: 353
 You seem to be repeating yourself.
Message: 354
 The # bows his head to you in greeting.
Message: 355
 I think that only schizophrenics say hello to a #.
Message: 356
 It is impossible to read in the dark.
Message: 357
 How does one look through a #?
Message: 358
 How can I read a #?
Message: 359
 How, exactly, do I ring that?
Message: 360
 Ding, dong.
Message: 361
 I'm not sure that a # can be melted.
Message: 362
 If you wish, but I can't understand why.
Message: 363
 Dental hygiene is highly recommended, but I'm not sure what
 you want to brush them with.
Message: 364
 A nice idea, but with a #?
Message: 365
 Well, you seem to have been brushing your teeth with some sort of
 glue.  As a result, your mouth gets glued together with your nose,
 and you die of respiratory failure.
Message: 366
 Unfortunately, the troll can't hear you.
Message: 367
 Inflating it further would probably burst it.
Message: 368
 How can you inflate that?
Message: 369
 Come on, now!
Message: 370
 The # isn't sleeping.
Message: 371
 This has no effect.
Message: 372
 does not seem to do anything useful
Message: 373
 is not notably useful
Message: 374
 isn't very interesting
Message: 375
 doesn't appear worthwhile
Message: 376
 has no effect
Message: 377
 doesn't do anything
Message: 378
 Kicking a # #.
Message: 379
 Waving a # #.
Message: 380
 Playing in this way with a # #.
Message: 381
 Fiddling with a # #.
Message: 382
 Pushing the # #.
Message: 383
 I don't think so.
Message: 384
 This cannot be tied, so it cannot be untied!
Message: 385
 How can you tie that to anything?
Message: 386
 You can't tie the # to that.
Message: 387
 You could certainly never tie the # with that!
Message: 388
 The # struggles and you cannot tie him up.
Message: 389
 Why would you tie up a #?
Message: 390
 You can't turn that.
Message: 391
 You certainly can't turn it with a #.
Message: 392
 Digging with the # is slow and tedious.
Message: 393
 Digging with a # is silly.
Message: 394
 I don't think that anybody is home.
Message: 395
 Why knock on a #?
Message: 396
 It sounds like there is something inside the #.
Message: 397
 The contents of the # spill out.
Message: 398
 I can't get to that to move it.
Message: 399
 You can't move the #.
Message: 400
 You can't turn that on.
Message: 401
 It is already on.
Message: 402
 You can't turn that off.
Message: 403
 It is already off.
Message: 404
 The # is now on.
Message: 405
 The # is now off.
Message: 406
 It is now pitch black.
Message: 407
 You must tell me how to do that to a #.
Message: 408
 The # cannot be opened.
Message: 409
 Opened.
Message: 410
 Opening the # reveals:
Message: 411
 The # cannot be closed.
Message: 412
 It is already open.
Message: 413
 It is already closed.
Message: 414
 Closed.
Message: 415
 There is a # here.
Message: 416
 You are carrying a #.
Message: 417
 It is in the #, which is in the room.
Message: 418
 It is in the #, which you are carrying.
Message: 419
 Time passes...
Message: 420
 The # must be on the ground to be boarded.
Message: 421
 I suppose you have a theory on boarding a #.
Message: 422
 You are already in the #, cretin!
Message: 423
 You are now in the #.
Message: 424
 You aren't in that!
Message: 425
 You realize, just in time, that disembarking here would probably
 be fatal.
Message: 426
 You are on your own feet again.
Message: 427
 You can't go there without a vehicle.
Message: 428
 You can't go there in a #.
Message: 429
 I see nothing special about the #.
Message: 430
 It is pitch dark.  You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
Message: 431
 You are in the #.
Message: 432
 The # has died.
Message: 433
 The troll, disarmed, cowers in terror, pleading for his life in
 the guttural tongue of the trolls.
Message: 434
 The troll, now worried about this encounter, recovers his
 bloody axe.
Message: 435
 An unconscious troll is sprawled on the floor.  All passages out
 of the room are open.
Message: 436
 A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages
 out of the room.
Message: 437
 The troll stirs, quickly resuming a fighting stance.
Message: 438
 The troll spits in your face, saying "Better luck next time".
Message: 439
 The troll laughs at your puny gesture.
Message: 440
 The troll, who is remarkably coordinated, catches the #
Message: 441
 The troll, who is not overly proud, graciously accepts the gift
Message: 442
 and not having the most discriminating tastes, gleefully eats it.
Message: 443
 and being for the moment sated, throws it back.  Fortunately, the
 troll has poor control, and the knife falls on the floor.  He does
 not look pleased.
Message: 444
 Sadly, a # can't be put in a #.
Message: 445
 You can't take the #.
Message: 446
 Aren't you forgetting something?
Message: 447
 That would be a good trick.
Message: 448
 The # is too big to jump over.
Message: 449
 You should have looked before you leaped.
Message: 450
 I'm afraid that leap was a bit much for your weak frame.
Message: 451
 In the movies, your life would be passing in front of your eyes.
Message: 452
 Geronimo...
Message: 453
 I don't think that the # would agree with you.
Message: 454
 I think you should get that first.
Message: 455
 Thank you very much.  It really hit the spot.
Message: 456
 How can I drink that?
Message: 457
 I'd like to, but I can't get to that.
Message: 458
 Thank you very much.  I was rather thirsty, probably from all
 this talking.
Message: 459
 The # catches fire.
Message: 460
 Unfortunately, you were holding it at the time.
Message: 461
 You don't have that.
Message: 462
 The # catches fire and is consumed.
Message: 463
 I don't think you can burn a #.
Message: 464
 It doesn't seem to work.
Message: 465
 Can you unlock a grating with a #?
Message: 466
 Munging a # #.
Message: 467
 Trying to kill a # #.
Message: 468
 Trying to attack a # #.
Message: 469
 There is nothing here to attack.
Message: 470
 I've known strange people, but attacking a #?
Message: 471
 with your bare hands is suicidal
Message: 472
 with that is very self-destructive
Message: 473
 You are in perfect health.

 valor, decides to terminate this little contretemps.  With a rueful

 Fortunately, he took nothing.

 A 'lean and hungry' gentleman just wandered through.  Finding

 A cyclops, who looks prepared to eat horses (much less mere
 adventurers), blocks the staircase.  From his state of health
 and the bloodstains on the wall, you gather that he is not very
 friendly, though he likes people.
Message: 608
 The cyclops is standing in the corner, eyeing you closely.  I don't
 think he likes you very much.  He looks extremely hungry, even for
 a cyclops.

 The cyclops, having eaten the hot peppers, appears to be gasping.
 His enflamed tongue protrudes from his man-sized mouth.

 The cyclops, perhaps affected by a drug in your drink, is sleeping
 blissfully at the foot of the stairs.

 Normally, I would offer to patch you up, but I'm ashamed to say my

 Please let me express my profoundest regrets.

 The thief, being temporarily incapacitated, is unable to acknowledge
 your greeting with his usual graciousness.

 You hear in the distance the chirping of a song bird.
Message: 636
 A metallic voice says, "Hello, Intruder!  Your unauthorized presence
 in the vault area of the Bank of Zork has set off all sorts of nasty
 surprises, several of which seem to have been fatal.  This message
 brought to you by the Frobozz Magic Alarm Company."
Message: 637
 An epicene Gnome of Zurich, wearing a three-piece suit and carrying a
 safety deposit box, materializes in the room.  "You seem to have
 forgotten to deposit your valuables," he says, tapping the lid of the
 box impatiently.  "We don't usually allow customers to use the boxes
 here, but we can make this ONE exception, I suppose..."  He looks
 askance at you over his wire-rimmed bifocals.
Message: 638
 The gnome looks impatient:  "I may have another customer waiting;
 you'll just have to fend for yourself, I'm afraid."  He disappears,
 leaving you alone in the bare room.
Message: 639
 Talk about eating rich foods!
Message: 640
 Nothing like having money to burn!
Message: 641
 "I wouldn't put THAT in a safety deposit box," remarks the gnome with
 disdain, tossing it over his shoulder, where it disappears with an
 understated "pop".
Message: 642
 The gnome carefully places the # in the
 deposit box.  "Let me show you the way out," he says, making it clear
 that he will be pleased to see the last of you.  Then, you are momentarily
 disoriented, and when you recover, you are back at the Bank Entrance.
Message: 643
 The gnome says, "Well, I never!" and disappears with a snap of his
 fingers, leaving you alone.
Message: 644
 The gnome appears increasingly impatient.

 There is an unpleasant grinding noise from inside the canary.
Message: 646
 The canary chirps blithely, if somewhat tinnily, for a short time.
Message: 647
 The canary chirps, slightly off key, an aria from a forgotten opera.
 From out of the greenery flies a lovely song bird.  It perches on a
 limb just over your head and opens its beak to sing.  As it does so,
 a beautiful brass bauble drops from its mouth, bounces off the top
 of your head, and lands glimmering in the grass.  As the canary winds
 down, the song bird flies away.

 The egg is now open, but the clumsiness of your attempt has
 seriously diminished its esthetic appeal.

 The concept of using a # is certainly original.
Message: 654
 Not to say that using a # isn't original either...

 As you try, your hand seems to go through it.

 Somewhat to the south, identical stone statues face each other from
 pedestals on opposite sides of the corridor.  The statues represent

 To the north is a large hallway.
Message: 688
 You are inside a rectangular box of wood whose structure is rather
 complicated.  Four sides and the roof are filled in, and the floor
 is open.
    As you face the side opposite the entrance, two short sides of
 carved and polished wood are to your left and right.  The left panel
 is mahogany, the right pine.  The wall you face is red on its left
 half and black on its right.  On the entrance side, the wall is white
 opposite the red part of the wall it faces, and yellow opposite the
 black section.  The painted walls are at least twice the length of
 the unpainted ones.  The ceiling is painted blue.
    In the floor is a stone channel about six inches wide and a foot
 deep.  The channel is oriented in a north-south direction.  In the
 exact center of the room the channel widens into a circular
 depression perhaps two feet wide.  Incised in the stone around this
 area is a compass rose.
    Running from one short wall to the other at about waist height
 is a wooden bar, carefully carved and drilled.  This bar is pierced
 in two places.  The first hole is in the center of the bar (and thus
 in the center of the room).  The second is at the left end of the room
 (as you face opposite the entrance).  Through each hole runs a wooden
 pole.
    The pole at the left end of the bar is short, extending about a
Message: 689
 foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole is resting on
 the stone floor.
Message: 690
 foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been

 through the bar to the circular area in the stone channel.  The
 bottom end of this pole has a T-bar a bit less than two feet long
 attached to it.  On the T-bar is carved an arrow.  The arrow and
 T-bar are pointing #.

 You are standing behind a stone retaining wall which rims a large
 parapet overlooking a fiery pit.  It is difficult to see through the
 smoke and flame which fills the pit, but it seems to be more or less
 bottomless.  It also extends upwards out of sight.  The pit itself
 is of roughly dressed stone and is circular in shape.  It is about
 two hundred feet in diameter.  The flames generate considerable heat,
 so it is rather uncomfortable standing here.
    There is an object here which looks like a sundial.  On it are
 an indicator arrow and (in the center) a large button.  On the face
 of the dial are numbers "one" through "eight".  The indicator points
 to the number "#".

 master himself materializes beside you and says, "Now that you have
 solved all the mysteries of the dungeon, it is time for you to assume
 your rightfully-earned place in the scheme of things.  Long have I
 waited for one capable of releasing me from my burden!"  He taps you
 lightly on the head with his staff and mumbles a few well-chosen spells.
 You feel yourself changing, growing older and more stooped.  For a
 moment there are two identical mages staring at each other among the
 treasures, then you watch as your counterpart dissolves into a mist
 and disappears, a sardonic grin on his face.
Message: 727
 Suddenly, as you wait in the dark, you begin to feel somewhat
 disoriented.  The feeling passes, but something seems different.
 As you regain your composure, the cloaked figure appears before you
 and says, "You are now ready to face the ultimate challenge of
 Zork.  Should you wish to do this somewhat more quickly in the
 future, you will be given a magic phrase which will at any time
 transport you by magic to this point.  To select the phrase, say

 The knock reverberates along the hall.  For a time it seems there
 will be no answer.  Then you hear someone unlatching the small wooden
 panel.  Through the bars of the great door, the wrinkled face of an
 old man appears.  He gazes down at you and intones as follows:
    "I am the master of the dungeon, whose task it is to insure
 that none but the most scholarly and masterful adventurers are
 admitted into the secret realms of the dungeon.  To ascertain whether
 you meet the stringent requirements laid down by the Great
 Implementers, I will ask three questions which should be easy for
 one of your reputed excellence to answer.  You have undoubtedly
 discovered the answers during your travels through the dungeon.
 Should you answer each of these questions correctly within five
 attempts, then I am obliged to acknowledge your skill and daring and
 admit you to these regions.
    "All answers should be in the form 'ANSWER, <answer>'."
